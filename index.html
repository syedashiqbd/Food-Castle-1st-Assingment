        <p>
          If life could only be as simple as following a recipe, we’d all be
          much happier. <br />
          However, unlike food based recipes, life doesn’t provide you with
          standardized <br />
          ingredients as each lives their unique life.

          <h2>Methi Paneer</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most popular vegetarian protein-rich foods, paneer is one
            desi cheese that we simply can't get enough of. The vegetable cream
            delight is made after milk is curdled using a fruit or
            vegetable-derived acid. And since it is made with milk, paneer
            proves to be a rich source of calcium too. It isn't just super-easy
            to make but also incredibly healthy to include in a high-protein
            diet, hence fitness enthusiasts include cottage cheese in their
            daily diet.

          <h2>Tandoori Chicken</h2>
          <p>
            Let's admit - we love grilled, roasted and barbecued foods. They are
            not only easy to make, but also need very few ingredients for the
            preparation. Besides, each of these food items need very less amount
            of oil (during preparation), making it a healthy option for both
            dieters and non-dieters. Considering the popularity, we bring you
            some amazing BBQ grill options that can help you make some perfectly
            roasted chicken, veggies and paneer at home, without any fuss. Let's
            take a look. .
